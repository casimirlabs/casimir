# Operator Groups

The default operator group provides secure and reliable native ETH rewards from an open registry of performant SSV operators. Casimir will deploy additonal operator groups with different registry requirements and opt-in features for stakers and operators. EigenLayer restaking is coming in our Eigen operator group, which will allow stakers and operators to participate in creating and managing native EigenPods with less (or more) than 32 ETH.
