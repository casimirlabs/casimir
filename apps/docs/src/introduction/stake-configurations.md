# Stake Configurations

The simple stake configuration provides secure and reliable native ETH rewards from an open registry of performant SSV operators. Casimir will deploy additonal stake configurations with different registry requirements and opt-in features for stakers and operators. Our simple restake configuration will allow stakers and operators to participate in creating and managing native EigenLayer pods with less (or more) than 32 ETH.
