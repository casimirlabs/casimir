# Staking Strategies

The base Casimir staking strategy provides a default configuration for secure and reliable native ETH rewards. Casimir also provides opt-in features by offering alternative staking strategies for stakers and operators to choose when depositing stake or collateral, respectively. The first of these opt-in features is EigenLayer restaking, which allows stakers and operators to participate in creating and managing native EigenPods with less (or more) than 32 ETH.
