# Staking Strategies

The base Casimir staking strategy provides a default configuration for secure and reliable native ETH rewards. We also plan to provide alterative (DAO-curated) staking strategies, for stakers and operators to enable when depositing stake or collateral, respectively. The first of these opt-in features is EigenLayer, which allows stakers and operators to participate in creating and managing native EigenPods with less than 32 ETH.
