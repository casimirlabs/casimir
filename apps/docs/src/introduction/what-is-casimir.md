# What is Casimir?

Casimir is a decentralized Ethereum staking platform that gives users intuitive access and control over their assets while their stake is attested by distributed validator technology (DVT). Casimir seamlessly connect stakers with any amount of Ether to a permissionless registry of high-performing node operators, who perform the duties of validators using shares created with distributed key generation (DKG). Stakers and operators can choose from multiple staking strategies, opening up a variety of new staking opportunities in addition to secure, simple staking.
