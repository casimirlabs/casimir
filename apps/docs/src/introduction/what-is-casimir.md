# What is Casimir?

## The Problem

## Casimir Staking

<!-- Currlently stakers either need to solo-stake (and have least 32 Ether), or they need to pool their assets in a liquid staking protocol (LSD). While the former choice is a reliably secure choice for Ether holders (if they have solid infrastructure), the latter, LSDs, often present an inherent counterparty risk to the user because of  their centralized control of staking node operators (see [The Risks of LSD](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd)).

Casimir is designed to offer users the experience and security of solo-staking while pooling their assets. The Casimir contracts seamlessly connect stakers with any amount of Ether to a permissionless registry of high-performing node operators. Casimir aims to minimize counterparty risk for users and improve decentralization in Ethereum staking:

- Validators duties are performed by registered (collateralized) operators running distributed validator technology (DVT)
- Keys are created and reshared using distributed key generation (DKG)
- Balance and status reports are reported by a decentralized oracle network (DON) -->
